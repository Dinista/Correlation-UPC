# Correlation-UPC

## Introduction

This project involves an analysis of the __correlation algorithm__ present in the __PolyBench collection__, parallelized using __UPC__, with the aim of analyzing and measuring the difference between the udp, smp, and mpi models. For comparison purposes the sequential algorithm was also implemented.

__In the folder <a href="">Docs</a> there's a Portuguese article that evaluates the algorithm's execution performance across various models, including udp, smp, and mpi, by a speed-up graph with different inputs__

## How it works

Correlation calculates the correlation coefficients, which are essentially normalized covariance.
